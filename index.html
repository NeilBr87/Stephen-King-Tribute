              <p>Since his first novel, Carrie, was published in 1974, Stephen King has captured the popular imagination and has taken his place as one of the greatest horror novelists of all time.</p>
              <p>Like his influences - chiefly HP Lovecraft and Edgar Allen Poe, he excels at telling stories of lurking horrors that beset small, idyllic towns, most of them loose adaptions of towns in Maine, New England that he spent time in throughout his life. You know the names of these towns even if  you're a novice to his work. There's Derry, Castle Rock, Jerusalem's Lot, and Haven, as well as several more. Stephen King dives deep into the darker side of human relations and insular small town life to present tales that manage to unnerve before the true horror even begins.</p>
              <p> A brief sampler of some of Mister King's greatest works are below:</p>
              <ul id="workslist">
                  <li><b>IT</b>: A young group of outcasts are thrown together by fate to fight against a monstrous inter-dimensional abomination. This creature strikes every 27 years and kills the children of the cursed town of Derry, Maine, shapeshifting into its victims' worst fears before devouring them. Can the outcasts conquer their fear and defeat It? And if It returns, will they have the courage to face it a second time?</li>
                  <li><b>Salem's Lot</b>: An ancient, bloodsucking evil has fallen on the peaceful town of Jerusalem's Lot, slowly spreading its corruption. Writer Ben Mears, relocating back to his hometown to finish his latest novel, may be one of only a small group of people who can stop it - once he confronts his dark past with Salem's Lot.</li>
                  <li><b>The Shining</b>: Writer and recovering alcoholic Jack Torrance receives a lifeline after alcohol and violence cost him his teaching job - winter caretaker of the Overlook Hotel, a resort hotel in the Rocky Mountains. Along with him is his wife, Wendy, and his son Danny - who is slowly getting to grips with mysterious psychic powers. As the family are cut off and the old ghosts of the hotel start to wake up, will Jack's sanity - and his family - survive?</li>
                  <li><b>The Stand</b>: A deadly pandemic is released from a top secret government lab. With the majority of the world's population dead, the immune survivors in the United States start to have dreams. Some of them are benign dreams from an old woman, Mother Abigail, telling them to join her in Nebraska. The others are sinister nightmares by a mysterious man calling himself Flagg summoning them to Las Vegas. Good will soon face off against evil - and there can be only one winner.</li>
                  <li><b>Needful Things</b>: A genial man with a sinister secret, Leland Gaunt, sets up shop in the town of Castle Rock. His store, Needful Things, will have the object of your heart's desire - but their price is something more valuable than money.</li>
              </ul>
